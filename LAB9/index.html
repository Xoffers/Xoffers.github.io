    <h1>Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Great burdens are borne with dignity. Certain duties arise from
        obligations that lead to unexpected challenges. Stand firm in the face
        of responsibility.
        Some seek what they cannot have, driven by ambition. Yet no one who
        blocks progress or claims another's success can truly thrive.
        For justice dwells in those who fulfill their roles with integrity, even
        when faced with trials that test their resolve.</p>
